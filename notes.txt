imports
import React from 'React'
'go and find that library and assign it to the variable React'

ReactDOM.render(App) 
passed a class instead of an instance, need to do => ReactDOM.render(<App></App>)
wrap class in JSX tags

EXPORTING MODULES => {
    import stmts 
    libs vs our own files
        libs => are namespaced so no need for file ref
        our own => give actual file reference
}

functional vs class based component

STATE => {
    each class based component has its own object called state

    AS SOON AS STATE CHANGES THE COMPONENT AND ALL CHILDREN RE-RENDER
}


CONTROLLED COMPONENT => {
    has its value controlled by state


    controlled input => {
        more declarative, value of the input is equal to the state...what if we want default input
    }
}

DOWNWARDS DATA FLOW => {
    The most parent compenent that's concerned with a piece
     of info should be the only component that fetches data

}

PASSING VIDEOS TO VIDEOLIST {
    pass the list of videos just by defining a property on the jsx tag
    passing the prop videos to VIDEOLIST
    Any time that App re-renders via setState, VIDEOLIST will get the new list
}
